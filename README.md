# Anki Template for English Learners

Enhance your vocabulary retention with our beautifully designed Anki template, tailored for English learners.

## Overview

This repository houses a trio of files dedicated to shaping the visual presentation of a card when displayed on the screen. Drawing inspiration from the aesthetics of a popular Chinese app, [墨墨背单词](https://www.maimemo.com/), we've streamlined the design, cutting out redundant features we believe most users won't require.

The versatility of this template means that with a bit of tweaking, it can be customized for your UI preferences or even adapted for other languages.

## Installation Guide

For those unfamiliar with Anki's card template structure, it comprises three segments:

- Front side
- Back side
- CSS (Styling)

To integrate this template into your Anki:

- Navigate to each file within this repository.
- Copy the content.
- Paste it into the corresponding section on Anki's card template editor.
- Voilà! Your card is now transformed.

Feel free to adjust the code as you see fit, ensuring it resonates with your learning style and objectives.
