# anki-template-for-english-learner

This versatile template serves as a valuable resource for expanding one's vocabulary in English. Moreover, with suitable modifications, it can facilitate the acquisition of new words in other languages, such as Spanish.

## What is this for?

This repo contains three files. They define how a card illustrates on the screen. 

The design of this UI referrs to one Chinese app called MOMO BEI DAN CI. Some abundant part has been cut since I do not think I would use them. 

You can modify the template as you wish, whether to change its UI or to suitable for other languages. 

## How to use the template? I don't understand the code.

Open anki. Copy and paste it to your anki... (I'll finish this later.)
